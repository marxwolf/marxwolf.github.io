* I am an Assistant Professor with Department of Computer Science at University of Wisconsin-Eau Cliare.

* Previously, I got my PhD from the [ECE depatment](https://engineering.usu.edu/ece/) at [Utah State University](https://www.usu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Rose Hu](https://engineering.usu.edu/ece/people/faculty/hu-rose).
* My research interests are machine learning application in wireless communication.

* I received my Bachelor's Degree in [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) advised by [Jin Zhang](http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/zhangj4/en/)
